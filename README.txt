========================


INTRO

Thanks for downloading the Jumplist Extender (JLE) v0.3 source! JLE is written primarily in C#, and its contents consist of:

/T7EBackground - The background process that assigns windows to their jumplists

/T7EPreferences - The config app that does all the work of setting up jumplists

/Libraries - External code library sources, used with T7EBackground and T7EPreferences
----/Windows API Code Pack - Windows 7 integration library for C#. Implements jumplists for .NET 3.5.
----/IconLib - A Vista-compatible icon library, useful for outputting various formats.
----/ImageComboBox - A ComboBox winforms control that displays icons with its entries. Compiled, but currently unused.

/Common - Miscellaneous resources that are used by both T7EBackground and T7EPreferences. They consist of program icons at first, but when you compile the main solution, the library DLLs will be placed here for T7EBackground and T7EPreferences to use.

/Extras - Extra standalone code snippets, e.g. beta jumplist code or sandbox tests. These are not compiled with the other projects.

The main solution will build into /bin, with everything you need to run the complete program.

To build an installation file, first install InnoSetup 5 or later. Then build NSISInstaller /by itself/ to activate the post-build actions that produce the install. (For some reason, it does not work when building the whole solution.)
