[size="3"][b]With Jumplist Extender, you can:[/b][/size]

[size="3"][b]Add your own Program Tasks[/b][/size]
[b]You can add any action you want on your jumplist,[/b] provided it has a keyboard shortcut to your program. Make easy-to-access jumplist items for your everyday tasks! [i](Works with command line switches, too!)[/i]

[size="3"][b]Pin Any Type of File[/b][/size]
[b]Add ANY file and ANY folder to your jumplist[/b] -- and even rename them on the list! Windows only allows you to add files assigned to (or "openable by") the program -- Extender bypasses that limitation.

Use AutoHotKey scripting to [b]extend and add functionality to your programs, easily accessible from your own jumplist![/b] Add a "Save to Desktop Notes" function to Notepad, or [url=http://i40.tinypic.com/2nps2d.jpg]add "Snip and upload to ImageShack" to Snipping Tool![/url]

[size="3"][b]Share your Jumplists with Others[/b][/size]
Export and import your jumplists into [b]"Jumplist Packs"[/b]! Upload your Jumplist Pack to the web, and [b]enable others to download and enjoy your work![/b]
